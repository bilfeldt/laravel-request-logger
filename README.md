Zero configuration logging of Requests and Responses to database or custom drivers in Laravel applications - no more issues debugging customer support requests.

| Version | Laravel     | PHP            |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1.*     | 8.* \| 9.*  | 7.4.* \| 8.0.* |
| 2.*     | 9.* \| 10.* | 8.1.* \| 8.2.* |

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require bilfeldt/laravel-request-logger
```

Publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bilfeldt\RequestLogger\RequestLoggerServiceProvider" --tag="request-logger-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bilfeldt\RequestLogger\RequestLoggerServiceProvider" --tag="request-logger-config"
```

## Usage

It is possible to enable logging of all or some requests conditionally using one of the approaches below.

### Enable log via middleware (Recommended)

This package comes with a convenient `requestlog` middleware that can be used to enable logging of request by simply registering the middleware on the routes (or route groups) you wish to log:

```php
Route::middleware('requestlog')->get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

### Enable via config file

The config file includes some convenient settings for enabling logging of all or some requests:

```php
// Enable all requests:
'log_methods' => ['*'],

// or enable all server errors
'log_statuses' => ['5**'],
```

### Enable log via request

This package adds a macro on the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class making it possible to enable logging directly from the request:

```php
/**
 * Index posts.
 *
 * @param  Request  $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $request->enableLog();

    //
}
```

### Unique Request UUID

This package adds a macro `getUniqueId()` for the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class which generates a unique request UUID that will be saved to the logs and that can be included as [Global Log Context](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/logging#contextual-information) which will pass it onto any application logging or error reporting. This id will per default also be added as a custom response header.

**This is an extremely helpful trick when debugging customer requests as both customer, application logs, reported errors and request logs (this package) now all include a single common UUID!**

```php
$request->getUniqueId(); // Example: 94d0e2d6-4cc6-449c-9140-80bca47d29b4
```

## Extending with custom Drivers

This package implements the [Laravel Manager Class](https://inspector.dev/how-to-extend-laravel-with-driver-based-services/) making it possible to easily register custom drivers either in your application or by third party packages.

An `example` driver can be specified as middleware parameters:

```php
Route::middleware('log:example')->get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

or via request macro:

```php
$request->enableLog('example');
```

## Pruning

The number of logged requests can quickly grow if you are not pruning the logs regularly. In order to keep the logs manageable, you can use the `prune` command to remove old logs as [described in the Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#pruning-models):

```php
$schedule->command('requestlog:prune')->daily();
```

Note that the default `RequestLog` model setup by this package will not be discovered as a "Prunable" model by Laravel default `model:prune` command as it does not reside in the `app/Models` directory. If you change this class in the configuration to a custom class this will be auto registered and the command above will be needless.

## Notes and advises

### Proxies and load balancers

When using proxies and/or load balancers then the IP address of the proxy/load balancer must be listed as a [Trusted Proxy](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/requests#configuring-trusted-proxies) for the users IP address to be correctly logged as the IP of the proxy itself will be logged otherwise.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
